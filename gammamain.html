        <h3>
            In this single player action-packed, unconventional sandbox shooter, you play as an infiltration and sabotage unit equipped with a powerful weapon capable of hijacking mechanical enemies and vehicles.

            From agile combat drones to heavily armoured tanks and gunships use the tools at your disposal to turn the tide of battle.
        </h3>


        <h1 class="header">Core Mechanic</h1>
        <h3>
            Mechanical characters and vehicles can be hijacked and controlled which requires energy, the player has an energy reserve which automatically recharges during the day.
            At night however the player needs to find energy or light sources that they can recharge from. The players shield uses energy when activated.

        </h3>

        <h1 class="header">Supported Platforms</h1>
        <h3>
            Primarily we are going to release on PC through Steam but are developing for consoles in mind like Xbox, PlayStation and the Nintendo Switch
            <br><br>
        </h3>

        <h1 class="header">Development Timeline</h1>
        <h3>
            We have the backbone of the game mostly complete and are actively working on the demo to attract investors. When the funding is secured we expect a 1, 2 year development cycle.
            Most of the work after the demo will be art assets and additional features for some levels. We will not be using generative AI for art assets in any capacity.
        </h3>

        <h1 class="header">Funding</h1>
        <h3>
            We need atleast $100,000 AUD to cover expenses for full-time development. This will cover the two year development cycle required.
